Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above.

The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination.

Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "When utilizing TFT LCD HMI panel s in applications where a fixed or partially fixed image remains displayed on the screen for extended periods of time, users may experience a phenomenon referred to by the LCD industry as Image Sticking. Image sticking, sometimes also called “image retention” or “ghosting\", is a phenomenon where a faint outline of a previously displayed image remains visible on the screen when the image is changed. Image sticking can be caused by: Static images No screensaver Sharp contrast transition (e.g. black\/white) High ambient temperatures How Image sticking can be avoided or reduced: Use the screensaver functionality (see SW manual). Changing constantly between static and dynamic images. Avoid excessive brightness differences between foreground and background elements. Use colors with similar brightness. Use complementary colors in follow-up images. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.15 - 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination.

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel .

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

With two-way communication use two pairs; one pair for communication and one pair for 0 V. The shield must be grounded at one end. The other end is usually grounded, but with longer distances or when there is a difference in the ground potential, the shield should be connected to the ground via 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor to prevent ground current in the braided shield. A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately.

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.15 - 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

"body" : "When utilizing TFT LCD HMI panel s in applications where a fixed or partially fixed image remains displayed on the screen for extended periods of time, users may experience a phenomenon referred to by the LCD industry as Image Sticking. Image sticking, sometimes also called “image retention” or “ghosting\", is a phenomenon where a faint outline of a previously displayed image remains visible on the screen when the image is changed. Image sticking can be caused by: Static images No screensaver Sharp contrast transition (e.g. black\/white) High ambient temperatures How Image sticking can be avoided or reduced: Use the screensaver functionality (see SW manual). Changing constantly between static and dynamic images. Avoid excessive brightness differences between foreground and background elements. Use colors with similar brightness. Use complementary colors in follow-up images. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.15 - 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet.

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

The other end is usually grounded, but with longer distances or when there is a difference in the ground potential, the shield should be connected to the ground via 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor to prevent ground current in the braided shield. A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.15 - 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the quick-connect terminal connector on the HMI panel and the chassis of the panel, see 2 in drawing above. Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point on the door, see 3 in drawing above. Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

The other end is usually grounded, but with longer distances or when there is a difference in the ground potential, the shield should be connected to the ground via 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor to prevent ground current in the braided shield. A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately.

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet.

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet.

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

"body" : "Initially, use the original cabling from Beijer Electronics primarily. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position, using all the fastening holes and the provided brackets and screws. Tighten the screws to 0.5 - 1.0 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above.

The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

"body" : "Initially, use the original cabling from Beijer Electronics primarily. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 ± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal (IP54 or greater, NEMA-4X) is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, CAN and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

"body" : "Initially, use the original cabling from Beijer Electronics primarily. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground.

Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "Installation Manual X2 extreme 7 HP Foreword All HMI panel s are developed to satisfy the demands of human-machine communication. Built-in functions such as displaying and controlling text, dynamic indication, time channels, alarm and recipe handling are included. The HMI panel works primarily in an object-oriented way, making it easy to understand and use. Configuration is carried out on a PC using iX Developer software. The project can then be transferred and stored in the HMI panel itself. Various types of automation equipment such as PLCs, servos or drives can be connected to the HMI panel s. In this manual, the term “the controller” refers to the connected equipment. This manual explains how to install the HMI panel .

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

The mutual capacitance may not exceed 52.5 pF\/m, and the cable area should be at least 0.25 mm 2 (AWG 24). 0 V, the reference voltage for communication should be included in the cabling. With two-way communication use two pairs; one pair for communication and one pair for 0 V. The shield must be grounded at one end. The other end is usually grounded, but with longer distances or when there is a difference in the ground potential, the shield should be connected to the ground via 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor to prevent ground current in the braided shield. A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

"body" : "When utilizing TFT LCD HMI panel s in applications where a fixed or partially fixed image remains displayed on the screen for extended periods of time, users may experience a phenomenon referred to by the LCD industry as Image Sticking. Image sticking, sometimes also called “image retention” or “ghosting\", is a phenomenon where a faint outline of a previously displayed image remains visible on the screen when the image is changed. Image sticking can be caused by: Static images No screensaver Sharp contrast transition (e.g. black\/white) High ambient temperatures How Image sticking can be avoided or reduced: Use the screensaver functionality (see SW manual). Changing constantly between static and dynamic images. Avoid excessive brightness differences between foreground and background elements. Use colors with similar brightness. Use complementary colors in follow-up images. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately.

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality.

The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality.

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 Nm± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. For IP65 UL\/NEMA Type 4X, Type 12, panel must maintain a flatness < 1 mm overall and < 0.05 mm\/mm with a surface roughness, Ra < 1.6μm. Installation to be through an EPL (Db)(Dc) enclosure for the applicable Dust Group, Temperature classiﬁcation and Ambient temperature range. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

"body" : "Initially, use the original cabling from Beijer Electronics primarily. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 Nm± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. For IP65 UL\/NEMA Type 4X, Type 12, panel must maintain a flatness < 1 mm overall and < 0.05 mm\/mm with a surface roughness, Ra < 1.6μm. Installation to be through an EPL (Db)(Dc) enclosure for the applicable Dust Group, Temperature classiﬁcation and Ambient temperature range. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

"body" : "The following is needed: A Phillips\/slot screwdriver Do the following: Unpack and check the delivery. If damage is found, notify the supplier. Place the HMI panel on a stable surface during installation. Dropping the HMI panel or letting it fall may cause damage. To cut a correct opening for the HMI panel , use the cut out dimensions in the outline drawing. A separate cut out drawing is available for download from the Beijer Electronics web site. For more information, see chapters HMI Panel Drawings and Technical Data . Make sure that the mounting surface of the cutout is smooth and cleaned from any burrs or debris. Install the HMI panel into the cutout. Secure the HMI panel in position by screwing the slotted thumb screw clockwise, allowing the built-in bracket to ﬂip out and tighten against the cabinet as shown. Tighten the screws to 0.7 Nm± 0.2 Nm. In cases where the front panel seal is critical, use a torque wrench to ensure all screws are torqued within the specification above. For IP65 UL\/NEMA Type 4X, Type 12, panel must maintain a flatness < 1 mm overall and < 0.05 mm\/mm with a surface roughness, Ra < 1.6μm. Installation to be through an EPL (Db)(Dc) enclosure for the applicable Dust Group, Temperature classiﬁcation and Ambient temperature range. Connect the cables in the specified order, according to the following drawing and steps. The image is illustrative only and may differ slightly from the actual panel. Connect cable A. Connect cable B, using 14-20 AWG (2.08–0.52mm 2 ), 180–220 N-cm torque. Connect cable C. Connect cable D. The recommended cross-section of the cable is 1.5 mm 2 . Carefully remove the protective film over the HMI panel display, take care to avoid static electricity that could damage the panel. The HMI panel must be brought to ambient temperature before it is started up. If condensation forms, ensure that the HMI panel is dry before connecting it to the power outlet. Ensure that the HMI panel and the controller system have the same electrical grounding (reference voltage level), otherwise errors in communication may occur. Ensure that the voltage and polarity of the power source is correct. Separate high voltage cables from signal and supply cables. Shielded communication cables are recommended. " },

Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point on the door, see 3 in drawing above. Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

Connect a strong but short grounding braid between the door and the device cabinet, see 4 in drawing above. Twist the cables onto the 24 V DC feed, see 5 in drawing above. 2 turns around the ferrite core provide 4 times the suppression of 1 turn. 3 turns around the ferrite core provide 9 times the suppression of 1 turn. The VESA mounting of the HMI panel does not provide a secure grounding connection between the panel and the device cabinet, see drawing above. To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

The Ethernet shield of the HMI panel is directly connected to the chassis, see 2 in drawing above. Check whether the other Ethernet unit has its shield directly grounded or grounded via a capacitor. In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

To ground the HMI panel : Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point. The grounding wires should be short and the conductor should have a large area. A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground. Multi-wire conductors are better than single wire conductors with the same area. A braided conductor wire with the same area is even better. The best is a short, thick grounding braid. " },

In many cases, connecting the shielded Ethernet cabling to the chassis at both ends is inappropriate. Humor grounding loops can occur. Unshielded cabling may even result in fewer communication errors. A good solution may be to use a shielded Ethernet cable, but to connect the shield at one end only. One option is to break the shield, see 3 in drawing above. A more elegant method is to expand the shielded Ethernet cabling with a piece of unshielded Ethernet cable, see 4 in drawing above. The shield can be grounded via an external 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor, see 5 in drawing above. This connects the HF transients to ground. " },

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "The maximum ambient temperature for the HMI panel is provided in the specifications. The ambient temperature refers to the temperature in the device cabinet which cools the HMI panel 's electronics. In most cases, the ambient temperature for the HMI panel is significantly higher than the device cabinet’s ambient temperature. If the cabinet is tall and there are a number of heat-generating devices, the temperature at the top of the cabinet is considerably higher than the temperature increase that would be expected. All electronics are sensitive to heat. The lifespan of an electrolytic capacitor is cut in half with an 8-10 °C increase in temperature. A 15-20 °C temperature increase results in a quarter of the lifespan etc. Rittal has a good program for estimating the anticipated average temperature in the cabinet as well as a large program for controlling the temperature in the device cabinet. An enamel-coated steel cabinet has a radiant heat value of 5.5 W\/m 2 per °C. Installing a fan inside the cabinet evens out the temperature, while moving air provides considerably better cooling than still air. Install the fan so that it sits in a cooler area and blows cold air against the HMI panel . If the fan is mounted at the top and sucks warm air upwards, the ambient temperature of the fan becomes higher, resulting in a shorter lifespan. An approximate value of the net power consumption for the HMI panel can be calculated by multiplying the supply voltage with the current drawn by the HMI panel . This is assuming that all supplied power is transformed to heat. Please ensure that the temperature will not exceed the maximum ambient operating temperature in the enclosure. This can be influenced by other heat generating devices. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

"body" : "We recommend using a dry, clean cloth to wipe off dust regularly. Use alcohol or ammonia-based cleaning agent for cleaning only when necessary. When other solvents or cleaning agents are used, be sure to follow manufacturers’ instructions. The agent should be applied to a clean cloth and should not be sprayed directly onto the panel surface. After cleaning the agent should be removed. Ammonia-based glass cleaners (typically 5-10% ammonia) or 75% alcohol can be used to clean the surface of PCAP and resistive touch panels. When you clean the surface of your touch panel, please follow these steps: Apply cleaning agent (alcohol, bleach, or glass cleaner) to a clean cloth. Make sure the cloth is well saturated. Wipe the touch panel surface in a “Z” motion (see illustration below). Dry the panel thoroughly with a dry cloth, removing as much of the cleaning solution as possible. Do not mix bleach and ammonia because this will produce a dangerous chemical reaction. Please do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the touch panel surface. Cleaning solutions containing bleach, alcohol, and ammonia are corrosive to touch panel surface coatings and ITO film. Do not leave the solution on the touch panel surface for more than 2 minutes. Make sure to remove all residue when finished cleaning. Do not use sharp tools to clean the surface of the touch screen. Do not use air guns, water jets, or steam, to clean the surface of the touch screen as they may damage touch screen functionality. If condiments, food, or drinks are spilled on the surface of the touchscreen, please remove it immediately. Ensure moisture does not seep through the cable connection area from the edges during cleaning. " },

Connect a wire or grounding braid, that is sized correctly according to local electrical codes, between the chassis of the HMI panel and the closest grounding point.

A long, thin grounding wire has a very high impedance (resistance) at high frequencies and does not guide disturbances to the ground.

If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Use shielded cables for RS-232 communication. Use twisted pair and shielded cabling for RS-422 and RS-485. Use the cabling intended for the bus type; Ethernet, Profibus, CC-Link, CAN, Device Net etc. Install and connect according to applicable specifications for the relevant bus standard. Use shielded cabling for Ethernet, preferably with foil and a braided shield. D-sub covers should be shielded, and the shield should be connected to the cover 360° where the cable enters. Connect the shield at both ends. With longer distances, there is a risk that the ground potential may be different. In that case, the shield should only be connected at one end. A good alternative is to connect the other end of the shield to the ground via a 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor. Both ends are then connected to the ground in terms of HF, but only connected to the ground at one end in terms of LF, thus avoiding the 50\/60 Hz grounding loops. Use an EMC cable gland or regular plastic cable gland, remove the outer jacket and connect the shield to the installation plate with a 360° metal cable clamp. Place the 24 V DC and communications cabling in one cable trunk\/cable duct and 230\/380 V AC in another. If the cables need to be crossed, cross them at 90° only. Avoid combining the cabling for stronger 24 V DC outputs with the communication cabling. Ferrite cores that are snapped onto the shielded cabling may remove minor disturbances. Large ferrite pieces that are snapped onto unshielded cabling and where the wires go 2-4 times around the cores are approximately 5-25 times more efficient. " },

"body" : "If a power supply that meets safety standards is used and only powers the HMI panel , there is no problem. See 1 in drawing above. However, if a 24 V unit that also powers other units is used, there is reason to be cautious, see 2 in drawing above. The HMI panel does not have insulation that meets safety requirements in the event of a potential short circuit between 230 V AC and 24 V DC. It is assumed that the 24 V power supply is secure, for example, SELV according to EN 60950 (protection against electric shock) and UL 950. Here is an example that explains why a secure 24 V DC power supply can be ruined by mixing 24 V relay contacts with 230 V AC relay contacts in a smaller controller. Check that the clearances and creepage distances between 24 V DC and 230 V AC fulfill EN 60950 or UL 950. If not, input a separate 24 V unit into the HMI panel . If there is a substantial distance between the relay contacts for 24 V DC and 230 V AC, it is OK to use the same 24 V devices for all feeds. See 3 in drawing above. Connect 0 V on the 24 V power supply to the ground, see 4 in drawing above. This offers three advantages: Safety is increased. The 24 V power supply is not live in the event of a faulty connection or short circuit between 0 V (24 V) and 230 V phase. Transients on the 24 V feed are connected to the ground. No risk that the 24 V feed is at a high level in relationship to the ground. This is not unusual since there is high static electricity. " },

"body" : "The HMI panel has galvanic isolation against the 24 V DC power supply but no galvanic isolation between the communication ports for RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 and USB. Only the Ethernet connection has galvanic isolation. When a PC is connected to the HMI panel , the internal 0 V (GND) of the panel is connected to the protective ground via the PC. A number of USB devices can have the shield connected together with the protective ground. Here, the 0 V (GND) of the HMI panel is connected to the protective ground when, for example, a USB memory stick, keyboard, or similar device is plugged in. If a number of units are connected that have a 0 V and a ground connection, and these are connected to various grounding points, there is a substantial risk of problems. Grounding currents go through communication cables, the rear plate of the controller, internally in the HMI panel , and can cause errors. Use external units to improve communication and achieve galvanic isolation. Westermo has good industry-standard insulators that are also insulated from the 24 V DC feed. It is very important to make sure that the 24 V feed in the external insulation unit is not connected to one of the communication outlets. If it does not have 100% insulation against the 24 V feed, disturbances and grounding currents from the 0 V on the 24 V side disrupt the communication. Using this type of unit solves one problem but creates a larger problem! A substandard installation may work now, but problems may arise when other devices are connected. " },

The other end is usually grounded, but with longer distances or when there is a difference in the ground potential, the shield should be connected to the ground via 0.1 μF \/ 250 V film capacitor to prevent ground current in the braided shield. A number of manufacturers recommend that the shield be grounded at each node. Various manufacturers have different systems for bus termination. Depending on the recipients’ design, the bus wires may be on the same level or require pull-up or pull-down to ensure that no faulty signals are detected when the bus is in resting mode (all transmitters are disconnected).

"body" : "Optimizing screen update time minimizes CPU load and ﬂash operations. This can make a signiﬁcant difference in graphic-intense projects that approach the limits of the panel’s capabilities. Screen changes are carried out most efficiently through a show screen action, either on a function key or an object. Screens with less content will in general load faster. Certain objects will take longer to load, such as an alarm viewer. If screens are frequently shown or used as a background, try to keep it as slim as possible.

The more screens that can be cached the more screens will load faster, hence it is preferred to keep RAM as low as possible to utilize it for screen caching. Large screens will take up more memory when cached and will possibly prevent smaller and more frequently used screens from being cached. It is possible to prevent screens from being cached by setting its Cached property to false. When utilized RAM reaches approximately 85% the application will start to remove screens from the cache in order to avoid the application from running low on memory. This implies that if the application utilize more than 85% without caching the application will not be able to cache any screens and therefore not experience faster screen switching times. " },

To be able to script inside iX Developer , any open Visual Studio Debug sessions needs to be closed first. Beijer Electronics only offers support for scripting for the included examples in iX Developer . Objects that can trigger events will show with expandable nodes in the Script view. Clicking the [ + ] of such a node expands it and shows the trigger events for the object. Double-clicking on an event inserts its method heading with an empty code body. Scripts are written in C# syntax. When actions are deﬁned for an object, this will have precedence over script code. Avoid using multiple trigger methods as this may lead to undesired behavior. Use either a script or define actions with the controls on the Actions tab. Avoid using Click Action Trigger actions in combination with Mouse Button Action Triggers . Creating scripts that block execution, waiting for other resources or user input, is not supported. The ValueOff and ValueOn events for internal variables are available for selection in script mode, but they are not executed when running the project. The ValueChangeOrError event is available in script mode, but it should only be used with controller tags. It does not support internal variables or system tags. If an external editor, e.g. Visual Studio, is used for editing a script, the cross-reference will not be updated when building the project in iX Developer . The Remove Unused Tags function will report tags used in these scripts as unused. For iX Developer to recognize a change made with an external editor, the script file needs to be opened in iX Developer and provided with just any small change using the script editor in iX Developer . Save the project once more before build. Avoid static state when using script since this might cause memory leaks. Always remember to unsubscribe events previously subscribed to, in order to avoid memory leaks. Complex behavior can be created using script code. Selections made in Layout view mode are kept when switching to Script view mode and vice versa. Nodes with edited script code are highlighted in the expanded tree view. Highlight of an edited node in the tree view It is possible to disable a script without deleting it, by right-clicking on a node with script, and selecting Unhook event handler . This excludes the script from being run, even though there is code, and the node will no longer be highlighted. Some objects, such as text boxes, list boxes and combo boxes, rely on script code for advanced behavior. " },

"body" : "The Delete button in Tags can be used to detect unused tags for immediate removal via the Remove Unused Tags dialog. Similarly, when building the project,a notiﬁcation of any unused tags will automatically be done by displaying the Remove Unused Tags dialog. To disable or enable pop-up of this dialog, go to Options in the File menu. Select Build options in the list and then select CheckForUnusedTags under Misc . Change the status of the function to True or False . Always review the candidates for removal prior to removing unused tags, since removing tags that are used in e.g. a script can result in a corrupt project. To be able to detect tags used in scripts, a certain syntax must be used. It is recommended to use the IScriptTag interface within the arguments list for the ScriptModule , thus enabling the ScriptModule to be used and reused without being locked to a speciﬁc tag setup. Use the syntax Globals.Tags.TagName for direct tag references within scripts and expressions. If an external editor, e.g. Visual Studio, is used for editing a script, the cross-reference will not be updated when building the project in iX Developer . The Remove Unused Tags function will report tags used in these scripts as unused. For iX Developer to recognize a change made with an external editor, the script ﬁle needs to be opened in iX Developer and provided with just any small change using the script editor in iX Developer . Save the project once more before build. The Sum method inside the script can be utilized in many different contexts. The following picture shows how Tag3 will contain the sum of Tag1 and Tag2 when the button is clicked. Notice that the tags used in scripts must be activated to work as expected.

These settings can be saved by clicking the Save mapping as import module button, and will then be made available for selection from the Import module drop-down list at next import. Click Import . It is now possible to deselect import of some tags. In case there are name conﬂicts, these can be handled by changing the name, overwriting, merging or skipping conﬂicting items. The actions taken are saved to a log ﬁle for future reference. If you select Overwrite , all settings for the existing tag will be overwritten. If you select Merge between empty data to data with value, the data with value is kept, to avoid tags with no address. For example: Tag1 with address C1, merging a CSV or TXT file with Tag1 with an empty address, results in a Tag1 with address C1. Tag2 with an empty address, merginga CSV or TXT file with Tag2 and address C2, results in a Tag2 with address C2. The imported tags are now added to the current project.

Max items per subscription : Enter the maximum number of items per subscription supported by the server. Connection delay (in ms) : The time in milliseconds the application will wait before connecting to the OPC UA server after the application has started. The intended use for this option is to create staggered connections between clients so not all clients attempt to connect simultaneously to the server. Sampling settings Use poll group values: If selected, the tags in the controller will have their sampling intervals based on their poll group values. Ultimately, the server will set this value based on it’s MinSupportedSampleRate and it’s AvailableSamplingRates. The final value will never be lower than the min. supported sample rate, and also, the available sampling rate closest to the desired value will be chosen. Sampling interval: The rate at which the server checks the data source for changes. Only get the latest sampling interval when polling: If the sampling interval is faster than the publishing interval, a queue of values may form in the server. When this box is checked, this queue will never contain more than the latest value. If unchecked, the queue size will be automatically calculated as the ratio of publishing interval to sampling interval, rounded up, so that all the samples will be included in the published notification.

The Blink settings can be entered either from the General group under the Dynamics tab, or from the Property Grid, under Animations . In both cases selecting Blink opens the Edit Blink Dynamics dialog. Parameter Description Blink Interval Constant blink intervals: Time in ms from when the object gets invisible one time until it gets invisible the next time. For HMI panel projects, the minimum value is 400 ms, and it is recommended to use a blink interval of a multiple of 400 ms to ensure a harmonic blink experience (400 ms, 800 ms, 1200 ms, 1600 ms etc.). For PC, the minimum value is 200 ms. The default value is 1200 ms for all targets, and the maximum value is 10,000 ms for all targets. Blink intervals bound to a tag: Parameter Description Select Tag for Blink Interval changes blink frequency based on the selected tag value. Blink Enabled Select Tag for Blink Enable makes it possible to enable and disable blinking depending on the selected tag value: When the tag value is equal to the given value (= True ), blink is enabled. When the tag value is not equal to the given value (= False ), blink is disabled. Security has higher priority than blink, and an object hidden by security cannot be made visible through blink. It is not recommended to use Blink on objects that should be used for user interaction. Related information General Group " },

It is recommended to keep to one of the selected transfer methods to avoid problems. When a project has been transferred to a PC using the Download command, the project normally starts automatically when the computer is started.

"body" : "Data can be logged and saved in the iX Developer database. Any number of tags can be connected to a data logger, and data values irrespective of type can be logged. A project can have multiple data loggers with different sampling alternatives. If you want to open a database ﬁle to inspect logged data, then you need to install an appropriate third party database viewer tool. Logged data can also be viewed in the trend viewer object by selecting a LogItem for a curve in the Edit Curves dialog. If iX Runtime is restarted at some point during the data logging, an additional empty row is added in the Data Logger table in order to clearly visualize the interruption in the Trend Viewer. Logging of data consumes system resources and memory. To save memory, it is preferable that all LogItems that should be logged with the same sampling intervals are placed in the same data logger. Any individual data logger database can be exported in csv format using the Database Export action. It is recommended to use the database export method rather than the backup method.

"body" : "The storage media in the iX panel is based on Flash SSD (Solid State Drive). Flash SSD has no moving or mechanical parts, which gives high and reliable performance. The Flash SSD can handle data very fast and efﬁciently and the data is controlled by the drive manufacturers’ conﬁdential algorithm. As the algorithm is intellectual property it is not possible to calculate the lifetime, the drive manufacturers only publish the numbers of reads and writes. Best practice is to minimize number of writes to maximize the lifetime of the Flash SSD. Follow the advice below to reduce the risk of premature wear out (before the estimated lifetime). A non working Flash SSD stops the panel from operating. Do not log values with higher accuracy than needed. For example, avoid logging of ﬂoating point values. Reduce high ﬂuctuating values by using the hysteresis functionality in the connected controller. Collect values with high ﬂuctuating values in the same logger and do not mix with stable values. Collect slow changing values in other loggers. Do not log with higher refresh rate than needed. Disable logging completely when information is not needed, for example when the machine is not running. Use default setting Log changes only in the property setting of the logger. Keep the log size to a minimum, as few rows as needed. Avoid extensive ﬁle writing when controlling storage via script.

"body" : "The Database Cleanup action can result in reduced database size and better database performance. The following are some scenarios where this action could be used: When a large amount of data is deleted from the database ﬁle it leaves behind empty space. This means the database ﬁle might be larger than necessary. Running the Database Cleanup action reclaims this space and reduces the size of the database ﬁle. Frequent inserts, updates, and deletes can cause the database ﬁle to become fragmented, where data for a single table or index is scattered around the database ﬁle. Running the Database Cleanup action ensures that each table and index is stored continuously within the database ﬁle. Having indexes in order improves performance. The Database Cleanup action works by copying the contents of the database into a temporary database file and then overwriting the original with the contents of the temporary file. When overwriting the original, a rollback journal or write-ahead log WAL file is used just as it would be for any other database transaction. This means that when performing a Database Cleanup action on a database, as much as twice the size of the original database file is required in free disk space. The Database Cleanup action will fail if there is an open transaction, or if there are one or more active SQL statements when it is run.   Before performing an export of a project the project size could be shrunk. This is done by first using the Clear Datalogger action, and then the Database Cleanup action.   If an unusually big amount of database transactions has been performed, a Database Cleanup could help boost database performance.

The license subscription is a package of device licenses, where each license can be attached to a device to enable the functionality. The Process data license is bought per device and enables the device to send tag data to acirro+. It determines how much data that can be collected and for how long it can be stored. This means: How many tags that can be used for a device. How often to take a sample value per tag. How often to send the data points to acirro+. For how long the data will be stored in acirro+. Please visit SmartStore for details on what each license type contains and to buy license subscriptions, https:\/\/smartstore.beijerelectronics.com .

If you only want to set up the device for sending device info, then proceed to the next chapter. If a lot of tags from an iX Developer project are to be added as cloud tags in acirro+, it can help to use WARP as described in Appendix A in chapter Set up a physical device with iX project, namespace and cloud tags via WARP , instead of following this chapter. Please note that if iX Developer 2.40 SP4 is used, then WARP must be used. Do the following; Go to acirro+ Cloud Tags tab and select Create Cloud Tag . Type in the Cloud Tag name . Please note that the name must exactly match the name of the tag in iX Developer . In the Namespace field, type in the name of the new namespace and press Enter. Add categories and a description if needed. Set the Sample interval . The sample interval refers to how often a value is sampled and stored on the device. Check the Store all transmitted values box, if all values for this tag should be stored in Azure. Set the Transfer multiplier . The Transfer interval refers to how often the stored sample data is sent to acirro+. To filter values with small changes, set a Deadband . The deadband filter allows the user to filter out small value changes. If a value change was smaller than the deadband, the value is not considered to have changed. This will make a big change on high resolution analogue signals. By using this we are reducing the resolution of analogue signals. This is an option for the user to sort out and only get values of interest. Make sure that the Sample interval and the calculated Transfer interval are not less than what is allowed by the intended device license . Repeat the steps above to add more cloud tags, but instead of creating a new namespace, select the existing one in the Namespace field dropdown menu. " },

Make the connection between the BoX2 and the acirro+ cloud device. The physical BoX2 device used, must be IIoT ready. Configure the IP-address in the Property Grid for BoX2 devices. Use LAN B for the acirro+ connection. For X2 devices it is possible to configure the IP-addresses directly in the operator panels Menu . For a BoX2 device, enter the serial number. When you have finalized the configuration, right click on the BoX2 device and select Generate BoX2 config file . Save the file to the root of an USB-stick. To update the network settings, you need to connect the USB-stick and cycle the power of the BoX2 device. Create an iX Developer project or import an already existing project ( Import external ) to the BoX2 pro object. This is done by generating or attach a premade iX Developer project to the device from context menu selection, import external. Save the project. iX Developer will open in a new window. Add tags to the iX Developer project and save. In WARP, right-click on the BoX2 pro object and select Add cloud tags for acirro+ . Set Namespace, select which tags you want to use and click Add . acirro+ is opened in your Web browser, log in if prompted. Select Cloud Tags and filter by your namespace (if it is not already filtered out). The license on devices that use namespace will limit the maximum number of tags that you can use in a namespace. Set properties for each Cloud Tag the same way as described in the chapter for setting up Namespace and Cloud Tags in acirro+. Follow the chapter for setting up the device in acirro+ and then, in WARP, right-click on the BoX2 pro object and select Download to device . Wait until the project has been downloaded successfully.
